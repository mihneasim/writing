will's js class


I've watched Will Sentance's class JavaScript: The Hard Parts, v2, and I liked it.
In my organisation, we dedicate about 1 day out of 10 for self development. Yes. During office hours, not moonlight coding - or at least that's the *deal*. You probably heard of something similar taking place at Google, on a Friday - and that's how Gmail was born. But here, we choose to invest it in the development of our craftsmanship.

As a Chapter Lead, I always struggled making my chapter take this seriously. It seems we have a greater desire to be good short-term contributors to the goals of the tribe, so we more than often still use this bit of time for the sprint-delivery itself, rather than for our own learning and development. Of course it is a trap; on the long-run we're rotting as engineers, blind to innovation opportunities, and growth. Becoming better professionals is what would really benefit the organisation, the projects, and the effectiveness of the delivery, as a whole.

After repeated kind requests to somehow leverage that chapter time, I asked a colleague to pick a class on Frontend Masters. Really, any class. I asked for his choice by 5pm the same day, or else I would take it for him. So I chose JavaScript: The Hard Parts, v2; as the type of work we're doing with web components and converting business logic from AngularJs to vanilla js classes did look like we need strong JS engineers with proper ownership on the fundamentals of the language.

And so, a couple of weeks later, my colleague returned to provide his opinion. Bracing myself for negative feedback on my choice of topic, I got particularly enthusiastic to hear that he considered the class "amazing". "We all use and think we know those things, but it helps to understand their underlying reasoning once again".

So just after Christmas, I had some spare time and gave it a shot. I went through the class myself. The content - indeed, 101 of Js. But I was immensely impressed by the way the class was built and delivered.

- the blackboard
- the "school" setup. Will has students, trainees, physically in his room (they don't appear in the shots, just rarely when one is "called at the blackboard"). You, as spectator, are an actual spectator to the learning act taking part between Will and his students. I've seen this before. It's highly, highly beneficial. Can't stress it enough:
 - you get a sense of - todo: of what?
 - it's auto-paced by the audience. The trainer will adjust speed and level to the audience. Will gets real time feedback from the students. He stops every now and then to ask for how much did they understand on the topic at hand. He asks for one of the three "thumbs" - thumb up = I got it, move on; thumb down = i don't get it; horizontal thumb = i need to ask a question (i need specific clarification).
